# Default subsampling schemes designed for different geographic scales. With the
# exception of the "global" region, most subsampling schemes define a large
# focal set of sequences related to a specific geographic entity (e.g., Africa,
# Switzerland, etc.) and a smaller set of contextual sequences from the rest of
# the world.
#
# Users can control the specificity of subsampling by defining as many
# subsampling sets as they require. For example, one may wish to include all
# sequences from California, many contextual sequences from the USA, and a few
# contextual sequences from the rest of the world.

# Each build defines its subsampling scheme by specifying a `subsampling_scheme`
# attribute whose value is the name of an entry in the subsampling configuration
# below or defined elsewhere in another configuration file.
