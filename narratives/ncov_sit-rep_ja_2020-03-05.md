## Executive summary

Using 169</tag> publicly shared COVID-19 genomes, we examined genetic diversity to characterize the spread of COVID-19 in different areas and infer the date of their common ancestor.



We find:
* COVID-19 was introduced into Italy at least twice with subsequent community spread ([go to this](https://nextstrain.org/narratives/ncov/sit-rep/2020-03-05?n=7)).
* This includes a cluster of sequences from 6 different countries where cases appear to have been exported from Italy ([go to this](https://nextstrain.org/narratives/ncov/sit-rep/2020-03-05?n=9)).
* Genetic sequence data supports the hypothesis of undetected, sustained spread of COVID-19 in the greater Seattle area since mid-January ([go to this](https://nextstrain.org/narratives/ncov/sit-rep/2020-03-05?n=10)).
* All the sequenced cases included in this analysis likely share a common ancestor sometime between mid-November and mid-December 2019. ([go to this](https://nextstrain.org/narratives/ncov/sit-rep/2020-03-05?n=11)).

## FAQs & Misconceptions

### FAQs

We know that a lot of people have questions about COVID-19.
We've set up a guide to try and answer some of those most frequently asked [here](https://nextstrain.org/help/coronavirus/FAQ):

</div>


### Misconceptions

A number of misconceptions have been circulated about the origins of the novel coronavirus.
During outbreaks like this one, the spread of information that's known to be incorrect can lead to more panic, and cause people not to trust scientists and governments, meaning they are less likely to follow advisories and take appropriate precautions.

In an effort to try and explain why these views are incorrect, scientists have addressed these theories at the pages below:

# [Phylogenetic analysis](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/2020-03-05?d=tree)

Here we present a phylogeny of 169</tag> strains of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) that have been publicly shared.
Information on how the analysis was performed is available [in this GitHub repository](https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov).

<br>

The colours represent the within-country region or US-state of isolation, with the x-axis representing the sample date.
The y-axis shows how the sequences are connected, and does not have any units of measurement.

<br>

Sample dates are useful, but they don't always show exactly how two sequences are related genetically - two sequences that are identical could have different sample dates, and so look far apart in this view.

<!-- This is left-side text -->
# ['Divergence' in Phylogenies](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/2020-03-05?d=tree&m=div)

We can change the view so that the x-axis now shows 'divergence' instead.

<br>

Notice how many sequences that looked different previously, now sit in a line vertically.
You can scroll up and down between the previous slide and this one, to see how the tree changes.

<br>

Divergence is measured as the number of changes (mutations) in the genome.
Some sequences may have zero mutations -- meaning they are all identical to the root (center) of the tree.
Other viruses have between one and eleven mutations.

<br>

Sequencing the genome of a large novel RNA virus in an evolving outbreak situation is challenging.
Some of the differences observed in these sequences may be sequencing errors rather than actual mutations.
Insertions, deletions, and differences at the ends of the genome are more likely to be errors and so we masked these for the purposes of this analysis.

<br>

Sometimes we will show the tree in 'time' view, and sometimes in 'divergence' view, depending on what we are trying to highlight.

# [Phylogenetic Interpretation](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/2020-03-05?d=tree)

We currently have sequences from samples taken in five different continents.
While the early cases were all directly linked to cases in Wuhan, associated with the seafood market outbreak, we now observe various different cases that show evidence for community spread or were imported from sources outside China.

<br>

Generally, repeated introductions from an animal reservoir will show significant diversity (this has been true for Lassa, Ebola, MERS-CoV, and avian flu).
The observation of such strong clustering of human infections can be explained by an outbreak that descends from a single zoonotic introduction event into the human population followed by human-to-human epidemic spread.

# [At least two introductions into Italy, with possible community spread](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/2020-03-05?d=tree&f_country=Italy)

We currently have 3 sequences from Italy, two of which are from the Rome area and one from Lombardy in northern Italy.

<br>

These 3 sequences share a common ancestor early in the epidemic (near the base of the tree, to the left), which strongly suggests that there were at least two introductions with community spread into Italy.

<br>

Dr Nuno Faria et al. give an excellent breakdown [here](http://virological.org/t/first-cases-of-coronavirus-disease-covid-19-in-brazil-south-america-2-genomes-3rd-march-2020/409) of how Brazilian and other global sequences show that "the outbreak in Northern Italy was likely the result of multiple introductions to the region and from not a single source."

# [Possible hidden transmission in Italy](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/2020-03-05?d=tree&label=clade:A1a&m=div)

The two sequences from Rome (29 January 2020) are directly connected to each other and both have a travel history to China.

<br>

We have switched to 'divergence' view to show that the two Italian sequences are identical, while other nearby sequences (from England, Brazil, Switzerland, the USA, and China) are actually separated from the Italian sequences by 2-4 mutations.

<br>

However, the Brazilian sequence (SPBR-02) has a travel history to Milan, in Lombardy, and it is thought that the Swiss sequence in this cluster also recently travelled to Italy. We do not know anything about the travel history of the USA sample. The England/09c isolate is a direct importation from China.

<br>

The English sample (from China) sits between the earlier Italian samples from Rome and the cases with known (Swiss, Brazilian) or possible (USA) travel to Italy. This means we should not assume that the older Italian sequences and newer Italian-associated sequences are directly linked. The more recent samples could come from another independent introduction to Italy.

# [Global Spread from Lombardy, Italy](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/2020-03-05?d=tree&label=clade:A2)

The sequence from Lombardy (Italy/CDG1/2020) clusters together with sequences with known travel history to Italy that were most likely infected there: the sequences from Mexico, Germany, Brazil & Finland.

<br>

The German "BavPat1" sequence is part of an introduction from China much earlier in the epidemic. Its similarity to the other sequence in the cluster (they are separated by only one mutation), could indicate undetected ("cryptic") transmission in Europe stemming from this early German cluster.

<br>

It could also be the result of two separate introductions to Europe - an unsampled sequence from elsewhere could fall between 'BavPat1' and the rest of the cluster. At the moment, we cannot say with certainty which scenario is correct.

# [Likely spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the Seattle area](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/2020-03-05?label=clade:B1%20&d=tree)

There are now several cases of COVID-19 reported in the greater Seattle area and the US in general.
The newly isolated and sequenced cases are genetically closely related to a case isolated in the middle of January in the same area.

<br>

There are two possible explanations for this.
The virus could have been introduced at least twice into the greater Seattle area from a common source in China.
However, another explanation is that the virus was circulating undetected in the area for a while.

<br>

Trevor Bedford (co-founder of Nextstrain) has written a great blog post about these possibilities, which you can read [here](https://bedford.io/blog/ncov-cryptic-transmission/).

<br>

The remaining recent Washington sequences tell us something else: These sequences from the greater Seattle area cluster together.
This strongly suggest community spread, and that the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been circulating in the area for some time already.

# [Dating the time of the most recent common ancestor](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/2020-03-05?label=clade:B1%20&d=tree)

The time of the most recent common ancestor (or tMRCA) of a set of sequenced cases denotes when these sequenced cases last shared a common ancestor.
This time can be as early as the time when a virus first entered the human population, but can also be substantially later, as shown in the figure below.

```auspiceMainDisplayMarkdown

## Date of the common ancestor of outbreak viruses

Several research groups and people have estimated the time of the most recent common ancestor - see [this post by A Rambaut](http://virological.org/t/phylodynamic-analysis-of-sars-cov-2-update-2020-03-06/420) or [this post by T Stadler](http://virological.org/t/evolutionary-epidemiological-analysis-of-93-genomes).

The common ancestor of all sequences is most likely between mid-November and mid-December.
This would be consistent with all currently sequenced cases descending from the [initial cluster of cases at the Wuhan seafood market](http://virological.org/t/phylodynamic-analysis-of-sars-cov-2-update-2020-03-06/420).
