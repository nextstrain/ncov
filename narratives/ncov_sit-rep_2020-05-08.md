# Executive summary

We analyzed 2,226 publicly shared COVID-19 genomes. By comparing these viral genomes to each other, we can characterize how COVID-19 is moving around the world and spreading locally. In this week's updates, we focus on recent spread across Asia. We report:

* Multiple introductions to Delhi during March 2020 from all over the world  
* Many separate introductions to Singapore, most of which do not appear to have spread further  
* Expansion of a large cluster of cases in Singapore likely driven by sociological factors
* Similar patterns of international spread that emphasize the urgent need for cooperative efforts

# [A note on sampling](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/asia/2020-05-08?c=country&r=country&d=map&p=grid&legend=closed)
We currently have sequences from samples taken in 28 countries in Asia. This is an incredible achievement -- sequencing an unknown, large RNA virus in the midst of a pandemic is difficult, and is only possible through the incredible work and timely sharing of data by scientists and physicians around the world.
<br><br>
While this data enables us to infer many useful characteristics of the outbreak and track its spread in real time, it's important to emphasize that our conclusions are limited by the available data.
<br><br>
For example, the map shows very few sequences from the Middle East. This is NOT because COVID-19 isn't circulating in these areas, or that these cases are not as crucial to understand; rather, we just don't have much data available from these areas. The size of each circle on the map indicates how much data is currently available from that area, rather than the true size of the outbreak.

# [Many separate introductions to Delhi during March](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/asia/2020-05-08?c=division&d=tree,map&dmax=2020-04-15&dmin=2020-03-01&f_country=India&f_division=Delhi&p=full&r=country&m=div)

Between March 1-April 15, 38 viral genomes from the Delhi area were sampled and sequenced (shown here).
<br><br>
In the middle of the tree, we see a sizable cluster of closely related cases. This is consistent with a single introduction, followed by local community spread.
<br><br>
However, it is crucial to consider the context of this cluster.  
Scattered across the tree, we also see many other small clusters and isolated cases, representing separate introductions from all over the world.
We don't have enough data to say what followed these other introductions -- if or how far they spread. But, we can say that the large cluster of cases is only part of the story.

# [Contextualizing the SARS-CoV-2 resurgence in Singapore](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/asia/2020-05-08?d=tree,map&dmin=2020-02-26&f_country=China,Singapore,India,Philippines&p=full&legend=closed&r=division)

In the last 10 weeks, SARS-CoV-2 has been introduced to Singapore many times, from multiple locations.
<br><br>
Most of these introductions have led to limited onward transmission (single cases or small clusters on the tree).
<br><br>
In the middle of the tree, however, we see a single introduction that led to extensive onward transmission.
This large, cohesive cluster is most closely related to samples from India and the Philippines.
<br><br>
This is consistent with [recent reports](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/28/world/asia/coronavirus-singapore-migrants.html) that the virus is spreading rapidly among vulnerable, confined populations of migrant workers in Singapore.
<br><br>
This illustrates how the extent to which an introduction spreads within a population depends on sociological factors and emphasizes why it is critically important to protect vulnerable groups.

# [Repeated introductions to Malaysia](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/asia/2020-05-08?f_country=Malaysia&d=tree,map&r=division)

We have 14 sequences from Malaysia on Nextstrain, sampled between late January and late March. These sequences group with several different clades, each of which was circulating mostly in other Asian countries. This suggests that there have been multiple introductions from the surrounding region into Malaysia.

# [Regional spread across Asia](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/asia/2020-05-08?d=tree,map&f_country=Japan,Jordan,Thailand,United%20Arab%20Emirates)

A similar pattern is repeated for many other countries in the region: multiple introductions, many of which were well-contained, but with a few that took off to spark local transmission. We encourage you to "Explore the Data Yourself". As shown here, you will observe similar patterns in Jordan, Japan, Thailand, and the United Arab Emirates. Similar patterns can also be seen for Kuwait, Georgia, Taiwan, and Vietnam
<br><br>
The consistency of this pattern is strong evidence that the virus frequently crosses international borders. Thus, in order to effectively control the epidemic in any one country, we must control the pandemic across all countries through coordinated international efforts.

# [What you can do](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/2020-05-08?c=country&d=map&p=full)
#### ...as an individual
* Practice strict social distancing, especially if you are in a vulnerable group.
* Remember that even if you are not super vulnerable, many people around you are; follow these practices to protect others.
* Wash your hands "like you just chopped a jalapeno and have to change a contact lens."  
* Stay home as much as possible -- especially  if you are sick; be prepared with extra supplies in case you need to self-quarantine.  
* If you are an employer, encourage your employees to work from home wherever possible.

#### ...as an official  
* Make testing free and broadly available.  
* Put strong social distancing measures in place.  
* Fund and implement extensive contact tracing efforts.  
* Financially support those impacted by social distancing measures.

# Takeaways

#### The outbreak in India is the result of many separate introductions from around the world.  
<br><br>
#### In Singapore, sociological factors accelerated the expansion of one introduction to become a large outbreak, in contrast to the many introductions which have not spread widely.
<br><br>
#### In Asia, most countries' outbreaks have a similar history: many separate introductions from other countries, some of which resulted in local spread. This pattern of multiple introductions over time emphasizes the need for international and regional cooperation to fully control the pandemic.
