# Executive summary

We analyzed XX publicly shared COVID-19 genomes. By comparing these viral genomes to each other, we can characterize how COVID-19 is moving around the world and spreading locally. In this week's updates, we report:

**North America**   
*

**Central and South America**
*

**Europe**  
*

**Asia**  
*

**Africa**  
*

**Oceania**
*

# [COVID-19 Resources](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/2020-03-27)
We've prepared some resources that are worth reading to familiarize yourself with COVID-19 and the virus that causes it, SARS-CoV-2, also known as hCov-19.
This information will make interpreting the data we present in this narrative easier.
<br><br>
If you aren't familiar with phylogenetic trees, we encourage you to check out the ['How to Read Phylogenies' narrative](https://nextstrain.org/narratives/trees-background/) and come back when you're ready.

# [A note on sampling](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/2020-XX-XX?c=country&r=country&d=map&p=grid&legend=closed)
We currently have sequences from samples taken in XX countries across 6 continents. This is an incredible achievement -- sequencing an unknown, large RNA virus in the midst of a pandemic is difficult, and is only possible through the incredible work and timely sharing of data by scientists and physicians around the world.
<br><br>
While this data enables us to infer many useful characteristics of the outbreak and track its spread in real time, it's important to emphasize that our conclusions are limited by the available data.
<br><br>
For example, the map shows very few sequences from the global south. This is NOT because COVID-19 isn't circulating in these areas, or that these cases are not as crucial to understand; rather, we just don't have much data available from these areas. The size of each circle on the map indicates how much data is currently available from that area, rather than the true size of the outbreak.

# [What you can do](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/2020-03-27?c=country&d=map&p=full)
#### ...as an individual
* Practice strict social distancing, especially if you are in a vulnerable group.
* Remember that even if you are not super vulnerable, many people around you are; follow these practices to protect others.
* Wash your hands "like you just chopped a jalapeno and have to change a contact lens."  
* Stay home as much as possible -- especially  if you are sick; be prepared with extra supplies in case you need to self-quarantine.  
* If you are an employer, encourage your employees to work from home wherever possible.

#### ...as an official  
* Make testing free and broadly available.  
* Put strong social distancing measures in place.  
* Fund and implement extensive contact tracing efforts.  
* Financially support those impacted by social distancing measures.
