# Executive summary

Here, we analyzed 723 publicly shared COVID-19 genomes. By comparing these viral genomes to each other, we can characterize how COVID-19 is moving around the world.

In this report, we highlight that the virus has been introduced and is circulating in many parts of the globe.
Knowing if and to what degree COVID-19 circulates locally and how mitigation measures can slow this spread requires a good knowledge of the local outbreak dynamics. This, in turn, requires widespread testing.
This emphasizes the importance of rapid testing with a strong focus on slowing local transmissions.

In this week's updates, we report:  

* Evidence for travel-related introductions to many parts of the world.  
* Many places with recent introductions can expect to see cases expand in 4-8 week timeframe. They should prepare now.   
* Many places that have recently implemented social distancing measures can expect to see cases continue to accumulate in the short-term, but new cases will likely plateau and decline in the medium- to long-term.
* Testing for both active infections and recovered individuals will be vital for coping with this epidemic.

# [A note on sampling](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/2020-03-20?c=country&r=country&d=map&p=grid&legend=closed)
We currently have sequences from samples taken in 36 countries across 6 continents. This is an incredible achievement -- sequencing an unknown, large RNA virus in the midst of a pandemic is difficult, and is only possible through the incredible work and timely sharing of data by scientists and physicians around the world.
<br><br>
While this data enables us to infer many useful characteristics of the outbreak and track its spread in real time, it's important to emphasize that our conclusions are limited by the availability of data.
Of the total number of cases, only a subset of patients are tested. Of those tested, only a subset of samples are also sequenced.
Which subset of cases is tested and sequenced can greatly vary across geographic regions and time.
Additionally, phylogenetic reconstructions of outbreaks are always associated with a degree of uncertainty.
<br><br>
Let's look at a few examples.

# [Some regions are underrepresented in these data](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/2020-03-20?c=country&d=map&f_region=Central%20America,Oceania,South%20America,Africa&legend=closed&p=full&r=country)
The map shows very few sequences from the global south. For example, we only have sequences from 4 of the 25 countries in Latin America where [the WHO reports](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200319-sitrep-59-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=c3dcdef9_2) cases of COVID-19. This is not because COVID-19 isn't circulating in these areas, or that these cases are not as crucial to understand; rather, we just don't have much data available from these areas.

# [Other regions are overrepresented in these data](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/2020-03-20?c=country&d=map&f_region=Europe&legend=closed&p=full&r=country)
In other areas, such as the Netherlands, there is a vast amount of sequence data available, relative to the total number of cases.
<br><br>
So, when reading this narrative, keep in mind that the size of each circle on the map indicates how much data is currently available from that area, rather than the true size of the outbreak. You can [read here](https://nextstrain.org/narratives/trees-background?n=8) about how this can effect our inferences of transmission.

# [Sequence data can cross-check travel histories](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/2020-03-20?legend=open&c=division_exposure&label=clade:A1a&d=tree)

Identifying where a given case was infected is important for understanding which areas are experiencing local transmission versus primarily travel-associated cases. Sequence data can help us differentiate between these scenarios.
<br><br>
Here, the tree is colored by the travel history of a case (when known). Looking at the Canadian sequence (Canada/BC_78548/2020) in the middle, we see that they have a reported travel history to Europe. This infection groups with other European sequences, showing that this case almost certainly is a travel-related infection.

# [Sequence data can cross-check travel histories](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/2020-03-20?c=division_exposure&d=tree&f_division_exposure=Iran&legend=open&p=full)

Zooming out, we can see that this isn't always so consistent.
<br><br>
Here, we can see that nearly all of the cases reporting recent travel to Iran cluster together in the middle of the tree.
<br><br>
Towards the top of the tree, we also see a Canadian case with travel history to Iran; however, this sequence doesn't group anywhere near the rest of the cases with Iranian travel history.
<br><br>
It's certainly possible that this person was infected by a second ongoing transmission chain in Iran, but until we get more data, we can't confirm that this infection was travel-acquired.

# [The virus has been introduced to nearly every country around the world](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/2020-03-20?legend=closed&c=country&d=tree,map&p=grid)

On the tree, we see lots of this kind of intermingling of samples from different countries.
This indicates that this kind of inevitable human movement has already introduced the virus to many parts of the globe.
<br><br>
In fact, [the WHO reports](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200319-sitrep-59-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=c3dcdef9_2) confirmed cases in 159 out of 195 total countries in the world.
<br><br>
However, not all introductions result in outbreaks.

# [Epidemics become evident ~4-8 weeks after introduction](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/2020-03-20?legend=closed&c=num_date&d=tree&f_division=Washington&label=clade:B1&p=full)

It may seem as though COVID-19 has suddenly exploded.
For many people, this outbreak may have gone from an abstract concern in other parts of the world to something that severely impacts their daily lives, seemingly overnight.
<br><br>
But, keep in mind that this has been brewing for awhile. It's not necessarily that the virus is being introduced to new places more often.
Most likely, many places are starting to become aware of localized outbreaks that were started by introductions several weeks ago.
<br><br>
Areas that aren't yet aware of local outbreaks should prepare now and start surveillance testing.  

<!-- This is the right-side text -->

```auspiceMainDisplayMarkdown
# How do introductions become outbreaks?

Sometimes these introductions don't result in secondary cases or localized outbreaks -- especially if the index case is detected and isolated quickly.
Many times, however, the virus spreads undetected through the local population until the outbreak reaches a significant size.

Below is a thought experiment showing how this played out in Wuhan. On the y axis we have space; on the x axis, we have time. Shaded area represents the number of cases.

"COVID-19 in Wuhan went from an index case in ~Nov 2019 to several thousand cases by mid-Jan 2020, thus going from initial seeding event to widespread local transmission in the span of ~10 weeks. We believe that international seeding events started to occur in mid-Jan. Thus we have a critical ~10 weeks from then to late-March to contain these nascent outbreaks before they become sizable." [- Trevor Bedford](https://twitter.com/trvrb/status/1226241284207038464), Feb 2020

These new outbreaks may, in turn, seed further introductions to other locations.

# [How outbreaks grow: an example](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/2020-03-20?legend=closed&d=tree,map&f_division=Washington&label=clade:B1&p=grid&r=location)

We can see a clear example of this in the data from Washington state.
Mousing over root of the main clade shows that the virus was likely introduced to this area between the end of January and the middle of February 2020 ([methods](https://nextstrain.org/narratives/trees-background?n=6)).
<br><br>
Now, in mid-March (~6 weeks later), we see that a local outbreak is in full swing in this area. From the sequence data alone, we estimate a doubling rate of 3-6 days, assuming an exponentially growing population.

# [How outbreaks spread: an example](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/2020-03-20?legend=closed&d=tree,map&f_division=Washington,Utah&label=clade:B1&p=grid)

We can also see an example of how initially localized outbreaks seed introductions to other locations.
The samples from Utah near the top of the tree (orange) nest within the main clade from the Washington outbreak.
This is consistent with an introduction from Washington to Utah, although it's also possible that there were intermediary step(s) in the transmission chain.
<br><br>
We don't know for sure whether this introduction will result in a local outbreak in Utah.
But, if the virus does continue to spread following these introductions, we would expect to see this unfold over the next 4 weeks.
<br><br>
This is just one example.
There may have been other introductions into Utah (or other areas) that we cannot see on the tree because they were not sequenced.
Most importantly, areas that aren't yet aware of local outbreaks should prepare now and start surveillance testing.

# [Mitigation measures take time, but they save lives](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/2020-03-20)

Following this same logic, there are likely many local transmission chains that we don't yet know about.
<br><br>
This means that even for areas that just implemented social distancing measures, we should still expect case counts to grow over the next few weeks.
These increases do NOT indicate that these measures aren't working. It just takes time for already-infected individuals (and possibly their household members) to manifest symptoms, be treated, and recover. We also expect to see a bump in the number of reported cases as testing becomes more widely available.
<br><br>
It is critical that social distance is maintained during this time. As shown on the right, case counts continue to increase after the intervention is put in place. But, over time, the cumulative number of cases is greatly decreased.

<!-- This is the right-side text -->

```auspiceMainDisplayMarkdown
## Social distancing doesn't stop all new cases overnight, but it greatly decreases case counts and fatalities over time
Social distancing -- that is, decreasing the number of people you encounter each day -- can be challenging, but is hugely beneficial to the public good.  
 If everyone decreased their daily contacts by 25%, we would expect to see a 50% decrease in the cumulative number of cases over the next month ([Klein et al., 2020-03-13](https://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/COVID-public/reports/Working%20paper%20%E2%80%93%20model-based%20estimates%20of%20COVID-19%20burden%20in%20King%20and%20Snohomish%20counties%20through%20April%207.pdf)).

# [Takeaways](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/2020-03-20?c=country&d=map&p=full)
- The virus has been introduced to many parts of the globe multiple times.  
<br>
- We see evidence of local transmission in many areas; beyond this, we expect that previous introductions have already seeded many local outbreaks that will become evident in the coming weeks.  
<br>
- Controlling local outbreaks through social distancing is crucial to:  
  - #FlattenTheCurve to prevent healthcare systems from being overwhelmed by many simultaneous cases  
  - Reduce the total number of cases and fatalities  
  - Allow time for the development of therapeutics and vaccines  

<!-- This is the right-side text -->

```auspiceMainDisplayMarkdown
# What you can do
## ...as an individual
* Dramatically reduce the number of people you are in contact with each day, especially if you are in a vulnerable group (e.g., seniors and those with pre-existing conditions).
* Remember that even if you are not super vulnerable, many people around you are; follow these practices to protect others.
* Wash your hands "like you just chopped a jalapeno and have to change a contact lens."  
* Stay home as much as possible -- especially  if you are sick; be prepared with extra supplies in case you need to self-quarantine.  
* If you are an employer, encourage your employees to work from home wherever possible

## ...as an official  
* Make testing free and broadly available.  
* Put strong social distancing measures in place.  
* Fund and implement extensive contact tracing efforts.  
* Financially support those impacted by social distancing measures (e.g., hourly workers, those with elder or childcare responsibilities, small businesses, etc.).
