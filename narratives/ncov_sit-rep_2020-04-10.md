# Executive summary

We analyzed 3,160 publicly shared SARS-Cov-2 genomes. By comparing these viral genomes to each other, we can characterize how SARS-CoV-2 (which causes COVID-19) is moving around the world and spreading locally.


We are in the process of moving to more specific, regionally-focused analyses. You can find more information about this change [here]() and how to help us out [here](); thank you for your patience during this transition.


This week's report focuses on transmission dynamics _between_ regions of the world, and is a bit shorter than usual. Here, we cover:  

* Early spread within Asia    
* Initial introductions from Asia to North America, Europe and Oceania  
* Growth of North American & European outbreaks  
* Subsequent spread across international borders within regions  
* Spread from Europe and North America to the global south  
* Coming full circle: reintroductions to Asia

# [COVID-19 Resources](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/2020-03-27)
We've prepared some resources that are worth reading to familiarize yourself with COVID-19 and the virus that causes it, SARS-CoV-2, also known as hCov-19.
This information will make interpreting the data we present in this narrative easier.
<br><br>
If you aren't familiar with phylogenetic trees, we encourage you to check out the ['How to Read Phylogenies' narrative](https://nextstrain.org/narratives/trees-background/) and come back when you're ready.

# [A note on sampling](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/2020-XX-XX?c=country&r=country&d=map&p=grid&legend=closed)
We currently have sequences from samples taken in XX countries across 6 continents. This is an incredible achievement -- sequencing an unknown, large RNA virus in the midst of a pandemic is difficult, and is only possible through the incredible work and timely sharing of data by scientists and physicians around the world.
<br><br>
While this data enables us to infer many useful characteristics of the outbreak and track its spread in real time, it's important to emphasize that our conclusions are limited by the available data.
<br><br>
For example, the map shows very few sequences from the global south. This is NOT because COVID-19 isn't circulating in these areas, or that these cases are not as crucial to understand; rather, we just don't have much data available from these areas. The size of each circle on the map indicates how much data is currently available from that area, rather than the true size of the outbreak.

# [Early spread within Asia](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/global/2020-04-09?d=tree,map&dmax=2020-01-15&p=full)

Here, we see samples from the first month of the outbreak.
Each tip of the tree represents a sample from an infected case.
Each internal node represents an unsampled case, which gave rise to all of the other cases within the descendant clade.
<br><br>
Tips are colored according to where they were sampled from; nodes are colored by the inferred (most likely) location of the ancestral case.
<br><br>
Comparing the trunk of the tree to the leaves helps us understand not only where infections are occurring, but also where they may have been acquired.  
<br><br>
During this early period, the majority of sampled and inferred ancestral cases were located in Asia.
This is consistent with circulation largely within Asia for the first month of the outbreak.

# [Initial introductions to other regions](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/global/2020-04-09?dmax=2020-02-15&dmin=2020-01-15&p=full&d=map,tree)

During the 2nd month of the outbreak, we start to see individual cases crop up in North America, Europe and Oceania.
These early samples still group with samples from Asia, and generally lack the hallmarks of local transmission.
<br><br>
This is consistent with initial sparks being thrown from the main outbreak in Asia to other parts of the world. Although most of these sparks did not result in localized outbreaks, at least two of these introductions took off.

# [Cryptic transmission in Europe from mid-January](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/global/2020-04-09?d=tree,map&dmax=2020-02-14&label=clade:A2&p=full)

Zooming in to the top of the tree for the same time period, we see an ancestral European virus (internal node) that later gave rise to the large European outbreak.
<br><br>
This indicates that while we hadn't yet sequenced any samples from this clade, the origins of the European outbreak were already cryptically circulating by mid-January.

# [Cryptic transmission in North America from mid-January](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/global/2020-04-09?d=tree,map&dmax=2020-02-14&label=clade:B1&p=full)

Similarly, zooming in to the bottom of the tree, we see an ancestral North American virus (internal node) that initiated what would later become a large outbreak in North America.
<br><br>
This indicates that although we only had 1 sequenced case from this cluster at the time, the virus was circulating cryptically within North America by mid-January.

# [Expansion of North American and European outbreaks](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/global/2020-04-09?dmax=2020-03-15&dmin=2020-02-15&p=full&d=tree,map)

During the 3rd month of the outbreak, these two clusters expanded to cause large outbreaks within Europe and North America, respectively.

# [Spread across international borders](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/global/2020-04-09?dmax=2020-03-15&dmin=2020-02-15&f_region=North%20America&p=full&r=division&d=tree,map)

Within each of these regions, we see widespread mixing across state lines and international borders.
This is demonstrated here by the intermingling of samples from multiple U.S. states and Canadian provinces.
<br><br>
We've previously reported on a similar pattern of frequent mixing of viral lineages between European countries.

# [Introductions from North America & Europe to other parts of the globe](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/global/2020-04-09?dmax=2020-03-15&dmin=2020-02-15&f_region=Africa,South%20America,Oceania&p=full&d=tree,map)

These clusters are not restricted to their respective regions. During this time period, we also see cases from South America, Oceania, and Africa against a backdrop of primarily European and North American clades. This indicates that there were frequent intercontinental introductions during this time period.
<br><br>
Interestingly, samples from the global south span the full breadth of the tree, indicating that these regions' outbreaks are mixtures of many viral lineages.

# [Coming full circle: reintroductions to Asia](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/global/2020-04-09?branchLabel=clade&d=tree,map&dmin=2020-03-14&f_region=Asia&p=full&r=division)

In the last month, the pandemic has come full circle. Here, we see re-introductions from Europe and North America back to Asia.
<br><br>
This resoundingly demonstrates that this pandemic is a global fight; we all must help control this virus everywhere if we hope to defeat it anywhere.

# [What you can do](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/2020-03-27?c=country&d=map&p=full)
#### ...as an individual
* Practice strict social distancing, especially if you are in a vulnerable group.
* Remember that even if you are not super vulnerable, many people around you are; follow these practices to protect others.
* Wash your hands "like you just chopped a jalapeno and have to change a contact lens."  
* Stay home as much as possible -- especially  if you are sick; be prepared with extra supplies in case you need to self-quarantine.  
* If you are an employer, encourage your employees to work from home wherever possible.

#### ...as an official  
* Make testing free and broadly available.  
* Put strong social distancing measures in place.  
* Fund and implement extensive contact tracing efforts.  
* Financially support those impacted by social distancing measures.
