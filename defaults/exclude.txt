# Per pre-print https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.10.197095v1 samples with 'a' and 'b' suffices from
# Gujarat are from the same sample but "heterozygous mutations" have been manually separated into two genomes (co-infection was assumed)
# Genomes with suffix 'a' are the major allele (60-80% of the Ion Torrent reads), so 'b' is being excluded. 1s is also a dupe (resampling)
