## Translating Nextstrain Situation Reports

We welcome translations of the situation reports (narratives) into languages other than English (in particular to languages commonly spoken in areas affected by the outbreak). We're incredibly grateful for and impressed by the contributions provided already!

### Getting started  

1. Check to see if the situation report is already available in your language on [the Nextstrain homepage](https://nextstrain.org). If the date is the same for the English version and the version in your language, then it's already up to date! :)  

2. Find your language\* on the [translation project board](https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov/projects/1), and comment on the issue so we know you're working on it.

3. Follow the instructions in the issue to submit your translation.  

4. **When you're done, please remember to move the issue to the "ready for review" column [in the project board](https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov/projects/1).** This helps us keep everything moving smoothly.

5. When your translation has been reviewed and approved by a second translator, we'll publish it and put it on the Nextstrain homepage!

### \*If your language isn't listed on the project board

We'd love to add even more languages! [Please open an issue here](https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov/issues/new?assignees=cassiawag&labels=&template=translation--community-request-.md&title=%5BLanguage+translation+request%5D); we'll get back to you right away!
