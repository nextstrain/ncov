*****************************************************************
A Getting Started Guide to the Genomic Epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2
*****************************************************************

This template and tutorial will walk you through the process of running a basic phylogenetic analysis on SARS-CoV-2 data.
We've created these resources with the goal of enabling Departments of Public Health to start using Nextstrain to understand their SARS-CoV-2 genomic data within 1-2 hours.
In addition to the phylogenetic analysis described here, you can use our "drag-and-drop" tool for a clade assignment, mutations calling, and basic sequence quality checks at `clades.nextstrain.org <https://clades.nextstrain.org/>`_.

We also recommend `this 1-hour video overview <https://youtu.be/m4_F2tG58Pc>`_ by Heather Blankenship on how to deploy Nextstrain for a Public Health lab.

If something in this tutorial is broken or unclear, please `open an issue <https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov/issues/new/choose>`_ so we can improve it for everyone.

If you have a specific question, post a note over at the `discussion board <https://discussion.nextstrain.org/>`_ -- we're happy to help!
