Introduction
============

These tutorials will walk you through the process of running a basic genomic surveillance workflow using SARS-CoV-2 data.
We've created these resources with the goal of enabling Departments of Public Health to start using Nextstrain to understand their SARS-CoV-2 genomic data within 1-2 hours.

At the end, you will be able to:

- create phylogenetic trees of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from different sources including GISAID and Nextstrain-curated GenBank data
- visualize the resulting trees in :term:`docs.nextstrain.org:Auspice`
- define subsampling logic for your own genomic epidemiological analysis
 
After completing these tutorials, you may wish to `learn more about genomic epidemiology <link to Alli's gen epi book or some other resources?>`_ or `review all possible options to configure your SARS-CoV-2 analyses with Nextstrain <../reference/configuration.html>`_.

If you prefer video format to working through these written tutorials, check out the :doc:`video tutorial walkthrough <../videos>`.

We also recommend `this 1-hour video overview <https://youtu.be/m4_F2tG58Pc>`_ by Heather Blankenship on how to deploy Nextstrain for a Public Health lab.
