The sanitize metadata script resolves duplicate metadata records for the same strain name by selecting the record with the latest database id. Multiple database id columns allow the script to resolve duplicates when one or more columns has ambiguous values (e.g., "?").

[See the SARS-CoV-2 tutorial for more details on defining subsampling schemes](https://docs.nextstrain.org/projects/ncov/en/latest/analysis/customizing-analysis.html#subsampling).

Each named subsampling scheme supports the following attributes that the workflow passes to `augur filter`.

### group_by
* type: string

* examples:
	* `year month`

### seq_per_group
* type: integer
* description: Number of sequences to select per group of records in groups specified by `group_by`. The total number of sequences selected for each subsampling rule will be no more than the number of groups times this number of sequences per group. This parameter must be used with the `group_by` parameter.

### max_sequences
* type: integer
* description: Maximum number of sequences to select for the current subsampling rule. When used with the `group_by` parameter, Augur will calculate the number of sequences per group. When used without the `group_by` parameter, Augur will select this number of sequences at random from all available sequences. When probabilistic sampling is enabled by the `sampling_scheme` parameter, the total number of strains actually selected will be more or less than this value due to the underlying Poisson sampling process.

### sampling_scheme
* type: string
* description: A flag to pass to `augur filter` that specifies whether to enable probabilistic sampling or not. Probabilistic sampling is useful when there are more groups than requested sequences.
* default: `--probabilistic-sampling` (Augur’s default)
* examples:
	* `--probabilistic-sampling`
	* `--no-probabilistic-sampling`

### exclude
* type: string
* description: Argument to pass to `augur filter` to exclude records based on specific values in metadata columns. This argument can refer to build-specific attributes with curly bracket notation as shown in the examples below.
* examples:
	* `"--exclude-where 'region!=Africa'"`
	* `"--exclude-where 'region!={region}'"`

### include
* type: string
* description: Argument to pass to `augur filter` to include records based on specific values in metadata columns regardless of other filters applied during subsampling (i.e., strains for which the include test evaluates to true will always be included if they exist in the metadata and sequences). This argument can refer to build-specific attributes with curly bracket notation as shown in the examples below.
* examples:
	* `--include-where 'region=Africa'`
	* `--include-where 'region={region}'`

### query
* type: string
* description: Argument to pass to `augur filter` to select specific records by testing values in metadata columns. This argument can refer to build-specific attributes with curly bracket notation as shown in the examples below. Query values support [pandas Dataframe query syntax](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#indexing-query) treating the metadata as a data frame.
* examples:
	* `--query "division == 'Washington'"`
	* `--query "division == '{division}'"`

* examples:
  * `--max-date 2021-04-01`
  * `--max-date 2021.25`

### priorities
* type: object
* description: Parameters to prioritize strains selected for the current subsampling rule. Currently, the workflow supports two `type`s of priority, `proximity` and `file`.
* description [proximity]: `proximity` selects samples that are genetically similar to the `focus` sample set; the `focus` sample set must be a rule in the current subsampling scheme.
* example [proximity]:
```yaml
subsampling:
  my-scheme:
    my-first-rule:
      max_sequences: 10
    my-second-rule:
      max_sequences: 10
      # Prioritize sequences that are genetically similar to
      # sequences in the sequences selected by the
      # `my-first-rule` rule.
      priorities:
        type: proximity
        focus: my-first-rule
```
* description [file]: `file` selects samples based on arbitrarily-defined rankings in a TSV file formatted as `strain\tnumber`. The numbers are only used to sort the samples, and are therefore arbitrary. Higher values = higher priority.

* example [file]:
```yaml
subsampling:
  my-scheme:
    my-first-rule:
      max_sequences: 10
      group_by: "country"
      priorities:
        type: "file"
        file: "path/to/priorities.tsv"
```

## crowding_penalty
* type: float
* description: used when calculating `priority scores` during subsampling to decrease the number of identical samples that are included in the tree during random subsampling to provide a broader picture of the viral diversity in your dataset.
* examples:
```yaml
priorities:
  crowding_penalty: 0.0
  # You may wish to set `crowding_penalty = 0.0` (default value = `0.1`) if you are interested in seeing as many samples as possible that are closely related to your `focal` set. 
```

## title
* type: string
* description: Title to provide to `augur export` and display as the title of the analysis in Auspice.

## traits
* type: object
* description: Parameters for inference of ancestral traits by `augur traits` with support for default traits and build-specific traits.
* examples:
```yaml
traits:
  default:
    sampling_bias_correction: 2.5
    columns: ["country"]
  washington:
    # Override default sampling bias correction for
    # "washington" build and continue to use default
    # trait columns.
    sampling_bias_correction: 5.0
```

Each named traits configuration (`default` or build-named) supports the following attributes.

### sampling_bias_correction
* type: float
* description: A rough estimate of how many more events would have been observed if sequences represented an even sample. [See the documentation for `augur traits` for more details](https://docs.nextstrain.org/projects/augur/en/stable/usage/cli/traits.html).
* default: `2.5`

### columns
* type: array
* description: A list of columns from the metadata for which ancestral trait values should be inferred for ancestral nodes.
* default: `["country"]`

## tree
* type: object
* description: Parameters for phylogenetic inference by `augur tree`. The tree “method” is hardcoded to `iqtree`.

### tree-builder-args
* type: string
* description: Arguments specific to the tree method (`iqtree`) to be passed through to the tree builder command run by `augur tree`.
* default: `'-ninit 10 -n 4'`

## auspice_json_prefix
* type: string
* description: Prefix to use for Auspice JSON outputs. Change this value to produce JSONs named like `auspice/<your_prefix>_global.json` for a build named `global`, for example. If you are using [Nextstrain's Community Sharing](https://docs.nextstrain.org/en/latest/guides/share/community-builds.html) to view your builds, set this value to your GitHub repository name and the `ncov` default. For example, if your repository is named `evolution`, set `auspice_json_prefix: evolution_ncov` to get JSONs you can view your `global` build at https://nextstrain.org/community/*your_github_organization*/evolution/ncov/global.
* default: `ncov`
