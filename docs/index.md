This template and tutorial will walk you through the process of running a basic phylogenetic analysis on SARS-CoV-2 data.
We've created these resources with the goal of enabling Departments of Public Health to start using Nextstrain to understand their SARS-CoV-2 genomic data within 1-2 hours.
In addition to the phylogenetic analysis described here, you can use our "drag-and-drop" tool for a clade assignment, mutations calling, and basic sequence quality checks at [clades.nextstrain.org](https://clades.nextstrain.org/).

We also recommend [this 1-hour video overview](https://youtu.be/m4_F2tG58Pc) by Heather Blankenship on how to deploy Nextstrain for a Public Health lab.

## Overview: complete walkthrough

### Getting started with analysis

The starting point for this section is a FASTA file with sequence data + a TSV file with metadata. You can alternately use our example data to start.

  1. [Setup and installation](setup.md)
  2. [Preparing your data](data-prep.md)
  3. [Orientation: analysis workflow](orientation-workflow.md)
  4. [Orientation: which files should I touch?](orientation-files.md)
  5. [Running & troubleshooting](running.md)
  6. [Customizing your analysis](customizing-analysis.md)
  7. [Customizing your visualization](customizing-visualization.md)

### Getting started with visualization & interpretation

The starting point for this section is a JSON file. You can alternately use our examples to start.

  8. [Options for visualizing and sharing results](sharing.md)
  9. [Interpreting your results](interpretation.md)
  10. [Writing a narrative to highlight key findings](narratives.md)

### Multiple inputs

  11. [Running the pipeline starting with multiple inputs](multiple_inputs.md)

## Reference guides

  - [Metadata field definitions](metadata-fields.md)
  - [Workflow configuration parameters](configuration.md)
