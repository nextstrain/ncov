## About  

This is a [Nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org) build for novel coronavirus, alternately known as hCoV-19 or SARS-CoV-2 that is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. This build is visible at [nextstrain.org/ncov](https://nextstrain.org/ncov).

### Data

The hCoV-19 / SARS-CoV-2 genomes were generously shared via GISAID. We gratefully acknowledge the Authors, Originating and Submitting laboratories of the genetic sequence and metadata made available through GISAID on which this research is based. For a full list of attributions please see the [metadata file](data/metadata.tsv).

### Bioinformatics notes

Site numbering and genome structure uses [Wuhan-Hu-1/2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947) as reference. The phylogeny is rooted relative to early samples from Wuhan. Temporal resolution assumes a nucleotide substitution rate of [8 &times; 10^-4 subs per site per year](http://virological.org/t/phylodynamic-analysis-176-genomes-6-mar-2020/356). There were SNPs present in the nCoV samples in the first and last few bases of the alignment that were masked as likely sequencing artifacts.

If you'd like to customize and run the analysis yourself, please see the [developer docs](./DEV_DOCS.md).
