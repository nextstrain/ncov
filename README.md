This is a [Nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org) build for novel coronavirus (nCoV), visible at [nextstrain.org/ncov](https://nextstrain.org/ncov).

## Data

The nCoV genomes were generously shared via [GISAID](https://gisaid.org). We gratefully acknowledge the Authors, Originating and Submitting laboratories of the genetic sequence and metadata made available through GISAID on which this research is based. For a full list of attributions please see the [metadata file](data/metadata.tsv).

## Situation Report Translations

We welcome translations of the situation reports (narratives) into languages other than English (in particular to countries affected by the outbreak), and have been very impressed with the contributions provided so far.
Please get in touch if you can help.

We suggest creating a branch for each language after the each release of the English version.
Unfortunately this means that the changes are not visible through nextstrain.org until release, but we are working on improving this.

The situation reports are generated from Markdown files (such as [this one](https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov/blob/master/narratives/ncov_sit-rep_2020-01-25.md) for 2020-01-25).

We welcome contributions from the community to make this effort as useful as possible to as many people as possible.

## Building

In order to run the Nextstrain build you must provision `data/sequences.fasta` and `data/metadata.tsv`.
nCoV genomes are not included as part of this repo as many of them are protected by the terms of GISAID sharing.
These genomes will need to be supplemented by the user.
To do so, register for an account at [GISAID](https://gisaid.org) and then navigate to EpiCoV and click "Download".
This should result in the file `gisaid_cov2020_sequences.fasta`.
Move this file to `ncov/data/gisaid_cov2020_sequences.fasta` and then run
```
./scripts/normalize_gisaid_fasta.sh data/gisaid_cov2020_sequences.fasta data/sequences.fasta
```
This should be everything needed to have data for the build process described below as metadata for these viruses already exists in `data/metadata.tsv`.

After this, the entire build can be regenerated by running

```
snakemake -p
```
with a [local Nextstrain installation](https://nextstrain.org/docs/getting-started/local-installation) or by running
```
nextstrain build .
```
with a [containerized Nextstrain installation](https://nextstrain.org/docs/getting-started/container-installation).

The resulting output JSON at `auspice/ncov.json` can be visualized by running `auspice view --datasetDir auspice` or `nextstrain view auspice/` depending on local vs containerized installation.

_This requires [Augur](https://github.com/nextstrain/augur) version >=6.3.0, released Feb 13, 2020._


## Genomic epidemiology notes

Site numbering and genome structure uses [Wuhan-Hu-1/2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947) as reference. The phylogeny is rooted relative to early samples from Wuhan. Temporal resolution assumes a nucleotide substitution rate of [0.8 &times; 10^-3 subs per site per year](http://virological.org/t/phylodynamic-analysis-176-genomes-6-mar-2020/356). There were SNPs present in the nCoV samples in the first and last few bases of the alignment that were masked as likely sequencing artifacts.

## Developer notes

API access to the evolutionary analysis that powers the visualization at [nextstrain.org/ncov](https://nextstrain.org/ncov) is available at [http://data.nextstrain.org/ncov.json](http://data.nextstrain.org/ncov.json). Schema information [here](https://github.com/nextstrain/augur/blob/master/augur/data/schema-export-v2.json).
