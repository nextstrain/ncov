# FIXME: move this comment to somewhere else then delete the entire entry.
# We wish to subsample 50k in the previous 12 months and 50k prior to that.
# Note 1: both --max-date and --min-date are inclusive of the boundary date,
#         so sequences from that date will be available to both sub-samples
# Note 2: As we group by (year,month) the boundary month will be included
#         in both sub-samples and thus this month will be oversampled.
#         For instance, if the boundary is March 7th then `50k_early` will sample
#         the same number of genomes from the first week of March as each of the
#         preceding months; similarly `50k_late` will sample as many genomes from
#         the final ~3 weeks of March as each of the following full months.
# (see https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov/pull/1032#discussion_r1034087312)
