# Custom settings for running builds on a SLURM cluster with DRMAA bindings.

# Cluster-specific settings for resources required by any rule. This file
# provides default resources for all rules and allows users to specify resources
# per rule by name. An important resource for the Hutch cluster is the requested
# "partition". Jobs submitted to the "restart" partition will start running
# almost immediately, but they may also be killed at any moment when someone
# else needs those resources. This is analogous to the spot resources on AWS.
